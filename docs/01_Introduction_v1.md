# 1. Introduction
## Project Overview
Albedo Auth is designed to provide a simple and reusable authentication and authorization solution for web-based projects. Initially intended for an ebook reading website, this service leverages Java Spring Boot's authentication and authorization features to offer user registration, role management, JWT-based token generation, and password reset functionality. While this implementation focuses on ease of use and simplicity, it provides a solid foundation for integrating basic auth features into various web applications.

## Objectives
- **User Registration**: Enable users to register with a username, password, and email.
- **Role Management**: Define and manage user roles and their associated permissions.
- **JWT-based Token Generation**: Implement secure token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Password Reset**: Allow users to reset their passwords through a secure process.

The primary goal of Albedo Auth is to provide a straightforward and functional authentication system that can be easily integrated into any web project, making it versatile and reusable.
